This could be text that you have read in from a file, html that you have pulled from the Internet, or any other text. From Python's perspective, a string (type `str`) is simply a collection of characters. \n",

    "In Python, strings are recognized as a collection of characters surrounded by a set of either single quotation marks (`'...'`) or double quotation marks (`\"...\"`). So long as you open and close your string with a **matching** set of single or double quotation marks, you are free to use either. The single caveat to that is that if you are writing an expression with a single quotation mark in it (such as \"Don't do that\"), you will **have to** use a matching set of **double** quotation marks. Let's experiment with some strings..."

The reason this matters to us in terms of our Python programs, though, is that Python expects our strings to be in one of a couple of different encodings (either `ASCII`, `utf-8`, or `unicode`). This isn't something you will run into often, especially not when defining your own strings (it's probably most prevalent when pulling text from the Internet). However, it's worth noting because there is a good chance that sometime in your Python career, you will end up with Python telling you it doesn't recognize a certain character in one of your strings, and an unexpected encoding will most likely be at the heart of that error."

    "Using indices like this, we can access any element of a string. But why is the element at index 1 `e`, and not `T`? After all, `T` is the first element in the string. It turns out that Python (and many programming languages) starts indexing at 0, which means that the first element in our string (and any collection that supports indexing) is accessed via indexing at 0. We refer to languages that work this way as **zero indexed**.  \n",
    "As for the negative numbers, this is a way to access elements starting from the end of the string, rather than the beginning. Indexing from the end starts from -1 and continues downwards from there. So, we would use -2 to access the `n` in the string.\n",

    "This indexing turns out to be pretty useful. You might notice, though, that when indexing from `[1:3]`, only the letters at index 1 and 2 are returned; when indexing from `[5:9]`, we get the letters at indices 5, 6, 7, and 8. Note that indices that you pass in are inclusive on the left side, and exclusive on the right side.\n",

    "What about those last two examples, where there isn't an ending index or a starting one? If you don't give an ending index, then Python assumes that your ending index is the last index in the string. Similarly, if you don't give a starting index, Python assumes that your starting index is the first index in the string. Remember, this is the zeroth index in Python (don't worry if this feels confusing, you'll get used to it quickly).\n",

    "We also can grab elements in a string at regular intervals. For example, what if we wanted to grab every second letter? Python allows us to do this by passing in an optional third number while indexing. This optional third number, also separated by a colon (`:`), tells Python the step size by which to move through the string when indexing. So, if we wanted to grab every second letter from the beginning to end, we could index with `[::2]`. If we wanted to grab every 3rd letter from the letter at index 2 to the letter at index 10, we could use the indexing `[2:10:3]`."

You can find what each letter denotes [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting). In the second case, we use brackets `{}` to denote where the replacement should take place.
