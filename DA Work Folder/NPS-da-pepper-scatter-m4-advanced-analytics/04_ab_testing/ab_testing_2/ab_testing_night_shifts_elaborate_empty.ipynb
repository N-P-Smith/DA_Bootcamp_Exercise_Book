    ">Imagine you are working as a waitress in a restaurant. It's only a summer job, but you’ve realized that your basic salary is nothing and that you need to make good tips to earn enough money for your winter ski trip with your high school friends. You’re not happy with your tips either, and you’re wondering if there is anything that could help you increase your salary.\n",

    ">You've decided to take a scientific approach and perform an A/B testing experiment. To be sure about what causes any potential difference, you decided to change only one thing at work and test its effect: the time of the shift (day shift or night shift). You’ve always worked during the day, but maybe evening shifts would be more profitable in terms of tips. Now you want to learn how to apply A/B testing methods to help you with your experiment."

    "   - **Option A:** Conversion Rate: tips per shift.\n",
    "   - **Option B:** Average Shift-Tips Amount.\n",

    "3. **Define Minimum Effect of Interest (MEI):** \n",
    "   - +5% Conversion Rate (CR) or +15% Average Shift-Tips Amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decide on the direction of change:** \n",
    "   - One-sided -> larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Formulate the Null Hypothesis:** \n",
    "   - $H_{0}$: The type of shift doesn't influence the tips conversion rate or average shift-tips amount.\n",
    "   - $H_{1}$: The type of shift will improve the tips conversion rate or average shift-tips amount by 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Consider the significance level $\\alpha$, Type I error (wrongly finding a difference):** \n",
