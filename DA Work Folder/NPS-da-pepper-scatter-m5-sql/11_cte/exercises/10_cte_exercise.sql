/* Airport Stats

 * In one table, how per airport in separate columns:
 *  - count of departures 
 *  - count of arrivals 
 *
 * BONUS: what other stats can be added?

/* Solve the Q3 question from JOINs exercise in  "09_joins_ex_airports.sql" 
 * but now with CTEs:
 * 
 * Q3. On a 2024-01-23 find 3 cities: 
 * - city the most count of flights (departing) per day
 * - city with the most unique planes departed
 * - city with them most unique airlines active

 -- Hint: We can use CTE to make it easier to understand the query. There is no "The best way."
