    "\n",
    "The PMF plot displays the probability of each possible number of defects occurring in a batch.\n",
    "You should see probabilities concentrated around a lower number of defects, \n",
    "consistent with a binomial distribution where the probability of defects is relatively low.\n",
    "Comparison to Histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the histogram to the PMF plot to determine if the histogram’s shape matches the expected Binomial distribution.\n",
    "If the histogram aligns well with the PMF plot, it suggests that the number of defects follows a Binomial distribution with the given parameters.\n",
    "If there are significant discrepancies, such as a histogram showing a different shape or distribution than the PMF, \n",
    "this might indicate that the data does not follow a Binomial distribution as expected.\n",
