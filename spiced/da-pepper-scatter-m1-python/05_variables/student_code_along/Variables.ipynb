    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful constructs in programming is the ability to store arbitrary values in what we call variables. You can think of variable assignment as giving a name to something so that it can be accessed later by different parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "variable assignment in Python occurs with the `=` operator. To assign a value to a variable name (i.e. declare it), you simply put the variable name on the left side of the `=` and the value you want to associate with that variable name on the right side. Once this has happened, you can access the value in the variable by using it's name somewhere later in your code or notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable can have any name as long as it follows the rules. Be creative but \n",
    "\n",
    "try to be as precise as possible! When naming things, please stick to these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Only use letters\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Write everything in lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Separate words with the underscore character `_`"
