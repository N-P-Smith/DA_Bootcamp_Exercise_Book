## __Part One: Intro into Pandas__ 
* Two ways to get a Pandas DataFrame:
    * *First*: Using already existing data in our Python program with Dataframe, meaning we create the
      the data while using 3 different methods: From a two dimensional list, from a dictionary or 
      while using a list of dictionaries
    * *Second*: Using an already existing data from outside of Pyhon which we imported and made accessible 
      via pd: first **import pandas as pd**; then (df = DataFrame, commonly used to defin the used DataFrame) 
      **df = pd.read_csv('path of the file.csv') 
* How to handel DataFrames:
    * We can handel DataFrames through attridutes:
          .index   .dtypes  for exemple, there are more attributes that we will learn in the future, 
                            in general attributes don't use ()
    * DataFrames can also be handeled with our already defined functions in Python:
          type()   len()    to name some exemples (they always have to refer to an object)
    * DataFrames are also handeled with funxtions which are implemented in pandas:
          df. describe()  df.info()  to name some of the most basic we have seen until now

### Reading and Writing DataFrames with Pandas

Pandas is a powerful and flexible data analysis/manipulation library available in Python, which 
provides numerous functions to quickly read data from, and write data to, various file formats. 
When working with tabular data, pandas primarily uses a DataFrame object, which is a two-dimensional
labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types.

#### Reading Data into DataFrames

Pandas provides a variety of functions to read in data stored in different formats. Below are some of the
most common methods used for reading data:

- **CSV Files:** 
  - Function: `pd.read_csv()`
  - Usage: Reads data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file into a DataFrame. 
  CSV is one of the most common file formats for tabular data due to its simplicity and wide adoption.
  
- **Excel Files:** 
  - Function: `pd.read_excel()`
  - Usage: Imports data from an Excel file. This is particularly useful when working with datasets
  that are initially created and stored using Microsoft Excel.

- **JSON Files:** 
  - Function: `pd.read_json()`
  - Usage: Parses a JSON string or file, converting JSON objects into a pandas DataFrame. JSON is c
  ommonly used for storing and exchanging data on the web where attribute-value or key-value pairs are prevalent.

Each of these functions comes with a host of parameters that allow for customization and handling of specific 
nuances in the data format (e.g., custom delimiters, specifying header rows, handling missing values, etc.).

#### Writing DataFrames to Files

To save your data for future use, share with others, or for further analysis in other software, 
pandas also provides several methods to write DataFrames back into various formats:

- **CSV Files:** 
  - Method: `df.to_csv()`
  - Usage: Exports the DataFrame `df` to a CSV file. This method is straightforward 
    and works great for flat data structures.

- **Excel Files:** 
  - Method: `df.to_excel()`
  - Usage: Saves the DataFrame `df` to an Excel file, which can then be opened in Excel or 
  other spreadsheet programs. This is particularly helpful when you need to share data with users
  who prefer Excel for data analysis or visualization.

- **JSON Files:** 
  - Method: `df.to_json()`
  - Usage: Writes the DataFrame `df` to a JSON file. This can be useful when interacting with web 
  applications or services that consume JSON.


##__Part two: Selecting rows and columns__

Key Concepts of how to handel rows and columns in a DataFrame:

| Command                       | Description                                           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| df[col]                       | select one column as a Series                         |
| df[[col]]                     | select one column as a DataFrame                      |
| df[[col1, col2, ... ]]        | select 2+ columns as a DataFrame                      |
| df['column_name'] = new_values| assign new values to the column                        |
| df.drop()                     | drop specified rows or columns                        |
| df['column'].astype()         | cast a pandas column to a specified dtype             |
| df.loc[row]                   | select one row as a Series by index                   |
| df.loc[[row1, row2]]          | select 1+ rows as a DataFrame by index                |
| df.loc[[row], [col]]          | select rows and columns as a DataFrame by index       |
| df.iloc[a:b, c:d]             | select rows/columns by integer-location               |
| df.set_index()                | set selected column as index                           |


### 1.1 Renaming the columns

df.columns =['']  Name the columns be writing the new Name of the columns inbetween the ''

### 1.2 Selecting a single column

df.['']  using single square brackets, we select a single column as a series

### 1.3 Selecting Multiple Columns

df[['','']] When selecting multiple columns, we HAVE to use double square brackets 

### 1.4 Changing column types

df.types to check if the DataFrames containe different data types, columns can only have one data 
type. If there are multiple "data types" there are strings which is the default

###  1.5 Creating columns

df['new columns'] = value 

### 1.6 Dropping columns

df.drop('name_of_the_column_we_want_to_drop', axis='columns') 
This is not inplace and does not change our DataFrame, to change our DataFrame we have to assigne the result
to another DataFrame and use the inplace=True parameter:

df_new = df.drop('year_collected', axis='columns') we assigne the new result to another DataFrame
                            OR
df.drop('year_collected', axis='columns', inplace=True) we replace the old DataFrame with the new result using
inplace=True

## 2. Selecting rows (and columns): `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` methods

### Here's a quick guide on how to use `loc[]`:

`loc[]` is a versatile selection method in Pandas that allows you to specify rows and columns to access based 
  on their labels.

- **Select a single row:** `df.loc['index_label']`
  
  Accesses the row with the specified label.

- **Select multiple rows:** `df.loc[['label1', 'label2']]`
  
  Retrieves multiple rows with the given labels.

- **Select rows by range of labels:** `df.loc['label1':'label3']`
  
  Selects all rows between and including the specified label range.

- **Conditional selection:** `df.loc[df['column'] > value]`
  
  Filters rows based on a condition applied to column values.

- **Select specific rows and columns:** `df.loc[['row1', 'row2'], ['column1', 'column2']]`
  
  Selects particular rows and columns by specifying their labels.

#### Important Notes:
- `loc[]` operates on the DataFrame's index labels and column names. It is particularly well-suited for DataFrames where these labels are meaningful.
- It's often used when the operations are based on the data's content rather than its position.
- When using `loc[]` to select rows by a range of labels, the end label is included in the output, which is different from typical Python slicing.

Mastering `loc[]` will enhance your data manipulation capabilities, allowing you to efficiently access and modify your data based on its labels.

## iloc[] Usage Guide

`iloc[]` provides flexibility in data selection within pandas DataFrames through integer indexing. Below are some common ways to utilize `iloc[]`:

- **Select a Single Row**: `df.iloc[5]`
  - This accesses the sixth row in the DataFrame since indexing starts at 0.

- **Select Multiple Rows**: `df.iloc[5:10]`
  - Retrieves rows 6 to 10, including the start index but excluding the end index.

- **Select Rows and Specific Columns**: `df.iloc[5:10, 0:2]`
  - Selects rows 6 to 10 and the first two columns.

- **Select Specific Rows and All Columns**: `df.iloc[[1, 3, 7], :]`
  - Accesses rows 2, 4, and 8 across all columns.

## Additional Tips

- Remember that `iloc[]` uses zero-based indexing, similar to indexing in native Python lists or numpy arrays.

- The end index in a range is excluded, aligning with standard Python slicing notation.

- With `iloc[]`, you can also access rows and columns in reverse order by employing negative indices.
