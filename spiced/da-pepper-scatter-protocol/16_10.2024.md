# WHAT IS DATA WRANGLING? 🧑‍🎓

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and organizing raw data to make it suitable for us.
In short, data wrangling is a crucial step that makes your data tidy and ready for analisis!

#  BUT WHAT IS TIDY DATA AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT? 🤔
Imagine you have a beautiful garden with different kinds of flowers...
If you just throw all the flowers into a big pile — some 🌹 roses, some 🌻 sunflowers, and some 🌷 tulips
it can be hard to see which flowers you have and how many of each. But if you organize your flowers into neat rows— one row of each of them,it’s much easier to see what you’ve got!

Data is essential because it provides valuable insights that drive decision-making and strategy. It helps organizations understand trends, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experiences. In a data-driven world, having accurate and relevant data is crucial for success and innovation.

# WHAT MAKES DATA TIDY? 📊

1. **Each Variable as a Column**: Columns represent individual variables.
2. **Each Observation as a Row**: Rows correspond to individual records.
3. **No Duplicates**: Avoid repeated entries in the dataset.
4. **Consistent Data Types**: Each column contains the same type of data.
5. **Meaningful Column Names**: Descriptive names for clarity.
6. **No Missing Values**: Complete datasets for analysis.

# FORMATTING DATA: WIDE TO LONG AND BACK 📊

## Wide to Long 🌐

To convert data from wide format to long format, you can use the `melt()` function in Pandas. This function reorganizes the data so that each row represents a single observation, which makes analysis easier.

## Long to Wide 🔄

To convert data from long format back to wide format, you can use the `pivot()` function. This reshapes the data by specifying the index and the columns, allowing you to revert it to its original structure.

Using these methods, you can easily switch between wide and long formats depending on your analysis needs. 🛠️

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND WIDE FORMAT 📊

## Wide Format 🌐

In wide format, each variable is represented as a separate column. 
This means that multiple measurements for the same subject or observation are spread across several columns. 
 
> 🚨 **Important Note :** Wide format is often easier to read for a quick overview 
but can be less efficient for analysis.

**Example**:  
| ID | Math | Science |
|----|------|---------|
| 1  | 90   | 85      |
| 2  | 80   | 75      |

---
## Long Format 🔄

In long format, each variable is represented as a single column,
 and multiple measurements for the same subject are stacked in rows. 
 > 🌼 **Important Note:**  This format is often more suitable for data analysis, especially
>in statistical modeling and visualization.


**Example**:  
| ID | Subject | Score |
|----|---------|-------|
| 1  | Math    | 90    |
| 1  | Science | 85    |
| 2  | Math    | 80    |
| 2  | Science | 75    |

> 🟠 **In summary:** Wide format is more compact and easier to read, 
>while long format is more versatile for analysis and modeling. 🛠️

 ## BUT WHAT IS PIVOT TABLE?

A pivot table is a tool to summarize data quickly.

### Why Use It?
- **Calculates totals** from large datasets.
- **Groups similar data** together.
- **Easily changes views** to see different information.

### Example:
**Sales Data:**

| Month     | Mangas    | Comics  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| January   | 100       | 150       |
| February  | 120       | 130       |

**Pivot Table:**

| Product   | Total Sales |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mangas    | 220         |
| Comics    | 280         |

Pivot tables help you find important data quickly! 🚀
