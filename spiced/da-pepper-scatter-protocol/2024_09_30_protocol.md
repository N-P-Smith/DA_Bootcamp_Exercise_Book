## __Introduction__
This week we started with understanding of how to use **Jupyter Notebook** for writing, executing, and documenting Python code. We also worked with **Python variables**, their various data types, and how to manipulate them for different use cases. We were also able to create, modify, and format **strings in Python**, leveraging a range of built-in methods for working with data.

## __Notes Day4__ 

* **Jupyter Notebook** - Web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. To proprely run jupyter notebook we first need to use the *`pip install notebook`*. This command always looks for the latest version of the package and installs it. Later we use the *`jupyter notebook`* command.
  
* **Data Types** - Python supports various data types, including basic ones like **int** (integer), **float** (floating-point number), **string** (text), and **boolean** (True/False).
   
* **Variables** - In Python, variables are used to store values that can be accessed later in a program. To assign a value to a variable, use the `=` operator, with the variable name on the left and the value on the right. Once assigned, the variable can be referenced by name throughout your code.

  When naming variables, follow these guidelines:
    * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character;
    * A variable name cannot start with a number;
    * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores *(A-z, 0-9, and _ )*;
    * Variable names are case-sensitive;
    * A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
     
  **REMEMBER** Being precise and consistent with variable names makes your code easier to read and maintain.

* **Strings** - one of the most common data types in Python, which represents a sequence of characters enclosed in either single `('...')` or double `("...")` quotation marks.

   *Key Concepts:*
 
   * **String Creation**: You can create strings using either single or double quotation marks. However, if a string contains an apostrophe (e.g., *`"Don't do that"`*), itâ€™s best to use double quotes to avoid syntax errors.

  * **String Operations:**
     * **Concatenation:** You can combine strings using the `+` operator. For example:

     * **Methods:** Strings come with built-in methods that allow you to manipulate and format text. Some commonly used string methods include:
       * `title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word:
         
         ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5ce76f6-dbd9-4344-bc6b-b86b45583103)

       * `split()`: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter:
   
         ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62a22fbf-c35c-435a-ae76-065161b5e5b1)

       * `replace()`: Replaces a part of a string with another string:
      
         ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d40195e-795f-4d9f-b62d-c4a75f172894)

  * **String Formatting:** You can dynamically insert variables into strings using **f-strings** or the `format()` method. This is especially useful for displaying variables in text:
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c42ad95-8ad0-402a-bfe5-4ed66385671b)

  * **String Indexing** - Strings in Python are zero-indexed, meaning the first character is at index `0`. You can access individual characters using square brackets
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f44bc35-4e38-4efe-b12d-e092b15c4bae)

    * **Slicing:** You can extract a substring using slicing, specifying a start and end index (end index is exclusive):
      
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/584142b6-44d6-4a68-a2cd-c89f4be48a54)

    * **Step Size:** You can also specify a step size when slicing to select characters at regular intervals:

## __Discussion Questions__

Q1. What is the best way to avoid syntax error if a string contains an apostrophe?  
Q2. What are the rules when naming a variable?  
Q3. What is the string method that capitalizes the first letter of each word?
