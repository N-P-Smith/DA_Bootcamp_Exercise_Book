# Day 5, 01.10.2024
<span style="color:grey">

Protocol owner: Ã–zlen Arslan
  
Today we kept working in Jupyter Notebook for Python code. We focused on Conditions and lists using syntax of if-statements (if, elif, else; nested if statements (and or and not)). Using comparison operators and define boolean variables.

### Quick notes: 
* always work in base
* If you're not in base type conda activate base
* You can either save the terminal by ctrl+s or through the function save in the menu
* if you kill the terminal in your VSC the notebook will not function on the browser
* don't use numbers, spaces for naming variables always use underscore
* = is to define a variable, == is for equal, != not equal

**if condition** allows us to check whether a certain condition is true and perform certain operations if they are.
the. While adding a if condition we have to create a column by using the enter function.
If the condition is false there will be no output as there is no connection.

The general syntax of an if-statement is:

An example, if we would like to check the eligibility of someone based on their age we have to condition the filter as we don't know the input:

**Note:** input() function always returns to string, that's why we always have to change the data type to int by adding int() at the beginning 

**elif and else**

In addition to if we do have two further statements to build on the if statement tree with `elif` and `else`. The `elif` is just like the `if` statement - it accepts a condition to check the truth of 
is executed when that condition evaluates `True`. The `else` is basically covering the rest. 

<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 22 17 36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28524b06-a373-4007-8710-75299ef9968d">

There can only be a one `if` and up to a single `else`, but any number of `elif`s in an `if`-`elif`-`else` block.

**Nested if statements: and, or, not**

The nested statements help us exclude certain data if more than one condition is true:

<img width="172" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 22 27 35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/678622eb-6025-41fd-b0c9-150a9b166cb9">

Here the nested if statement is checking if x is greater than 5 and if so the conditional block is entered. As a next steps it checks if x is less than 10 and if the outcome is true it prints x.

And requires both conditions to be true, or the outcome is false. Or requires only one condition to be true.

We can combine several statements with this code:

**Lists**

Lists allow us to store multiple data in one viriable.
List items are ordered, mutable, allow duplicate values and can hold items of any type.

Ordered: Items have a defined order that does not change. If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Mutable: It means, we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Duplicates: Lists can have items with the same value.

Mixed Types: Items in a list can be of the same type or a mix of different types.

There are two ways to construct a list 
1. By passing an arbitrary number of items into square brackets, `[]`, separated by commas. 
2. By passing an iterable into the `list()` constructor

List items are indexed: the first item is 0, the second 1 etc.

**List operations**

**List methods**

Adding an element to the list:

can be done by **append()**

<img width="454" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 22 58 57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/043c3273-3a7a-4aa5-ba06-4b03c268c7f7">

**len functions**
this will tell you the number of elements within the list. If the list contains more than one list within, it will give you the number of lists.

*append and extend*

extend will add a list at the and of the list as a single element while append will add elements as single

**Slicing**

Note: the ending index is non-incusive
