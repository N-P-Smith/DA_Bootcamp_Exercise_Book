## Statistics in Python + Aggregation & GroupBy
Protocol writer: Isadora Batagin

<span style="color:grey">
In these module parts, we discussed the basics of descriptive statistics and how to apply them to a DataFrame with pandas. During the second part of the class, we discussed the data aggregation methods and Group By.

# <span style="color:black"> __Part One: Descriptive Statistics with Python__ </span>
<span style="color:grey">

## <span style="color:black"> __General Concepts__ </span>
**Statistics:** Collecting, cleaning, analyzing datasets, and subsequently making quantitative assertions about a broader population or phenomena.

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Describe and summarize the main features of a dataset.
Utilizes metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance to describe data attributes.
Examples: Average Temperature of Berlin in January.

* **Inferential statistics:** Uses the data collected from a sample to make predictions or inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. 

**Population & Sample:**

* **Population:** The complete set of items or individuals that share one or more characteristics from which data can be gathered and analyzed. 

* **Sample:** It is a smaller collection of units from the population intended to represent the larger group.

**Categorical & Numeric Variables:**

* **Categorical:** They represent types of data that can be divided into groups rather than numerical values.

* **Numeric:** They quantify amounts and allow for mathematical operations, providing a basis for most statistical analyses and data science applications.

## <span style="color:black"> __Measures of Central Tendency__ </span>

* **Mean:** Calculated as the average value of all the numbers in a dataset.
  - Formula: *Mean* = Sum of all values / Number of values
  - Method: `.mean()`
    
* **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
  - Method: `.mode()`

* **Median:** The middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest.
  - Method: `.median()`
    

## <span style="color:black"> __Key Measures of Dispersion__ </span>

* **Variance:** It provides a measure of how data points differ from the mean.
    
* **Standard Deviation:** It provides a measure of the average distance between the values of the dataset and the mean

* **Range:** It represents the difference between the highest and the lowest values in the data set.

* **Methods:** `.min()`, `.max()`, `.std()`

* **Quantile:** In the case of a dataset, it refers to the division of the data into equal-sized subsets based upon their values. `.quantile()`
`
* **Correlations:** Mutual connection between two or more variables: values from -1 : 1. Describes the strength of linear relationship between two variables. `.corr`

* **BoxPlot:** `.boxplot()`

<span style="color:grey">
 
## <span style="color:black"> __Pandas Aggregation and Grouping__ </span>

- `groupby()`: Allows us to group the data based on one or more variables and then apply aggregation functions to each group.

- `agg()`: This function is used in combination with `groupby()` to specify the aggregation functions to apply to each group.

- Using method chaining: multiple operations can be applied in sequence using dot notation. For example, `groupby().agg().reset_index()`.

- **Pandas Grouping + Descriptive Statistics:** mean(), median(), sum(), min(), max(), std(), var()

- `size()` function to count the number of records in each group.

- `count()`  to count non-null values within each group for specific columns.

- **Others:**

    - `.value_counts()`: count of unique values
 
    - `.value_counts(normalize=True)`: for corresponding percentages

## **Aggregation and Group By üêß**

**Pandas Aggregation** - Different Options

- **To calculate the mean, median and standard deviation of the penguins bill length**

  - As a list: `penguins['bill_length_mm'].agg(['mean', 'median', 'std'])`
    
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/588b3ee2-408a-485b-b43a-000bb1a49551)

  - As a list of columns: `penguins[['bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm']].agg(['mean', 'median', 'std'])`

  - Using a dictionary:

  - Using a tuple (you can name the result row index):

### 5. What was the average life expectancy in Europe in 2015? Hint: first filter for 2015 then apply groupby.

### 8. What is the highest population a continent ever had? Hint: group by multiple columns

### 9. Which continent had that population and in which year?
